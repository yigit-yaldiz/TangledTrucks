# Tangled Trucks

Clone of "Twisted Tangle" and "Car Park Jam". I've used Obi Rope and Spline Asset in this project. Vehicles on the stage are connected to each other with ropes. By untying the ropes of the vehicles which are between the vehicles, we ensure that the vehicles leave the parking lot. When the ropes are untied, the vehicles leave the scene by following the spline on their own.
